# UDM

The goal of the UDM project is to create and publish an open, extendable and freely available data format for exchange of experimental information about compound synthesis and their testing.

This is the official UDM version maintained and further developed after completion of the original UDM project run by Pistoia Alliance.  In order to allow these activities, the UDM licence was change to the MIT one.
